<li><p>Refund Policy
Stating in interest of recuriters, that if an employee resigns the job within 60 days , counted from the date of effect of the contract between employer and the employee , then either 75% of the acquired commission is refunded to the recruiter or we will on our behalf recommend maximum of two employees without asking for any kind of commission. If the recruiter goes for the latter, then in that case, the second employee is provided if and only if the first employee resigns before a tenure of 60 days. If the first employee sustains for a period longer that 60 days, then in that case, we will NOT be providing the second employee without commission. But after the third resignation of the employee, we fail to provide you with any such scheme. Three resignations will blacklist your organization meaning in future you will not be able to avail any of the stated policies. This policy prevails for only a particular job stated classified under.</p>
