                        Atmanirbhar is an HR service provider, aiming to eradicate unemployment from the country by the end of the decade. Here at "Atmanirbhar", we look forward to creating a positive recruiter-employee bond where the recruiter can post job opportunities to which an aspirant can apply. The entire world has been under a severe lockdown since long. There is an endless list of people who went jobless and are impuissant to earn even a meal. They have lost all hopes of procuring jobs for feeding their family and need to get a job and start again. To produce employment, we lead to establishing a bridge between the workers and people who need them.
